"faq.survey.text.1" = "An Investment Fund - Is it like the stock market?";
"faq.survey.value.1" = "The investment funds managed by Objectway Asset Management are investment companies (i.e. SICAV: investment companies with variable capital). When you invest in a Objectway fund you become a shareholder of that fund. The money you invest is pooled with the money invested by other shareholders and managed collectively by Objectway Asset Management S.A. The assets of the fund are mainly invested in a diversified portfolio of securities selected by the fund managers according to a set of criteria. As the portfolio encompasses shares or bonds issued by international companies you own a \"piece\" of the stock market and participate in its performance. Over the last 25 years, despite financial crises and recessions, the global stock market has returned on average 6.3% per annum on top of inflation. Investing in a global fund managed professionally by experienced fund managers is an easy way to participate in the potential performance of the stock market";

"faq.survey.text.2" = "How do we know what Objectway Asset Management is doing with our money?";
"faq.survey.value.2" = "Firstly, when Objectway Asset Management manages a Fund, it does it in accordance with the investment objective and investment policy stated in the Fund prospectus and the Key Investor Information Document (KIID). These documents state what type of investments the Fund can hold and the level of diversification of the portfolio. Secondly, when you invest in an Investment Fund, you are not invested in virtual assets. You become the co-owner of securities issued by international companies we select based on a series of criteria such as the quality of their products, services and management. Companies that are managed to grow and create wealth. As transparency is one of the pillars of our business philosophy, we are committed to informing you on a regular basis about what our fund managers are doing with your money - and why. Every quarter, we send out a detailed report so that each investor can see, for each fund, the content of its portfolio, its performance and the main reasons for selecting the investments.";

"faq.survey.text.3" = "Does zero risk exist?";
"faq.survey.value.3" = "In the investment world, there is no such thing as \"zero risk\"; nothing is certain. History has shown repeatedly that nobody is immune to accidents: the real estate market can crash, governments can default on their debts, currencies can depreciate, companies can go bust... Furthermore, many so-called \"low-risk\" assets currently offer negative real yields. Over the past 3 years interest rates on savings accounts have been lower than inflation resulting in a negative yield of -1% per annum. As a consequence their purchasing power is gradually diminishing. Taking all these factors into account, we believe that spreading risks over different asset classes is wise. Investing a portion of your long term savings in the stock market makes good sense and is a clever way to manage your assets. At Objectway Asset Management, we do not blindly follow indices. We study each individual investment rigorously. Since its creation in 1988, Objectway Convertible International has successfully weathered stock market storms - turning crises into opportunities.";

"faq.survey.text.4" = "Investing in the stock market: is this wise in the middle of a crisis?";
"faq.survey.value.4" = "The European crisis, with its trail of depressing statistics, concerning growth rates, unemployment and bankruptcy, gives a grim but somewhat inaccurate image of the world economy. What's happening on a global level is that economic growth is continuing. Since the recession of 2009 it has been above 3% per annum and should, according to the IMF, reach 4% within two years time - a rate that is higher than the average over the past 30 years. This reality reflects various different situations, with some regions or sectors structurally weak while others are showing strong growth. Objectway Asset Management firmly believes that crises also provide opportunities that must be actively and steadfastly pursued.";

"faq.survey.text.5" = "Why is it better to invest for the long term?";
"faq.survey.value.5" = "Many investors allow themselves to be swayed by current events and tend to think about their portfolio only in the short term. If they observe the average returns of the stock market over a 20-year period, they find them attractive. If, however, they look at these returns on a year-by-year basis, they are scared by the fluctuations and will most likely prefer not to invest in shares. In reality it''s all a question of time horizon, flexibility, method and determination. Provided you accept a certain level of risk and take a global perspective there are always investment opportunities in some sectors or regions of the world. To harvest these opportunities, you can call on seasoned portfolio managers that have the experience of the global stock markets, and will not recommend selling when it is time to buy or buying when it is time to sell. This is the philosophy shared by the fund managers at Objectway Asset Management.";

"faq.survey.text.6" = "Is my money available at all times an in a bank account?";
"faq.survey.value.6" = "The value of an investment in the stock market may go up as well as down. In order to maximize the chances of benefiting from the potential reward from your investments, it is best to consider them as long term investments. The Key Investor Information Document (KIID) of Objectway funds indicates a minimum recommended time horizon you should consider. However, you can redeem your shares in the fund whenever you want, with no cost (except for possible taxes). You recover your investment at the net asset value (NAV) calculated on the day after the fund receives your instruction to sell. You will find a daily update of the funds'' NAV on our web site.";

"faq.survey.text.7" = "Is it worth combining multiple funds?";
"faq.survey.value.7" = "The old saying that it is better not to put all your eggs in one basket also applies to Objectway Funds. It may therefore be wise to entrust your investments to several managers.In addition, a healthy diversification of risk implies a balanced distribution of several asset classes (shares, bonds).";

"faq.survey.text.8" = "What is the minimum amount required?";
"faq.survey.value.8" = "Before the creation of Objectway Online, access to the Objectway Fund at Objectway Asset Management Belgium was only possible with a minimum investment of € 250,000. As we want to give an opportunity to everyone to benefit from the potential performance of our global funds we now offer two Objectway Funds with a minimum investment as low as € 250.";

"faq.survey.text.9" = "Why team up with Objectway Bank?";
"faq.survey.value.9" = "It is important for us to offer all our clients solutions that are professional, user-friendly, and competitively priced. We have chosen to team up with Objectway Bank, an effective and affordable online bank that is solid and reliable. Indeed, it was nominated 'Best Bank of the Year 2010' by the voters of MoneyTalk magazine. Being online also guarantees a quick and easy access to your investments - whenever and wherever.";

"faq.survey.text.10" = "Investing with Objectway Online: just how simple is it?";
"faq.survey.value.10" = "Investing with Objectway Online is very simple. You can sign up in three steps. Each of these has been carefully thought out to make it easy for you, while ensuring – needless to say – all the necessary rigour. After entering your e-mail address, you will be directed to the website of our partner Objectway Bank where you can open an investment account in a quick and easy manner. Once this account is open you can invest in the Objectway funds of your choice. We will then regularly keep you informed on the management and performance of the funds you invested in.";

"faq.survey.text.11" = "Will my money be safe?";
"faq.survey.value.11" = "It goes without saying that past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The value of your investment fund can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you originally invested. That is why our managers work tirelessly to manage the risks of the funds. To do this, they build a portfolio that is diversified across sectors and regions to spread the risk and avoid dispersing the funds across too many assets. When investing in a Objectway Fund, you become a shareholder of an investment company. This means that you are the beneficial owner of the fund''s assets, not the bank nor Objectway Asset Management.";

"faq.survey.text.12" = "Exactly who is responsible for what?";
"faq.survey.value.12" = "As an investor you are responsible for assessing if an investment in a Objectway fund is suitable for you including whether or not you are able to afford the risks of such investment. Objectway Online provides information on the main features of the funds and makes available to you different documents you must read before deciding to invest, including the fund''s Key Investors Information Document (KIID) and its prospectus. Objectway Asset Management''s responsibility is to manage the funds diligently in accordance with the terms of the relevant prospectus. Therefore, it is our responsibility to do everything in our power to manage those assets in a professional manner. The main responsibilities of Objectway Bank regarding Objectway Online are the execution of your orders to buy or sell shares in the Objectway funds, and the safekeeping of these shares on your behalf. It is therefore important that our customers can rely on recognised professionals.";
