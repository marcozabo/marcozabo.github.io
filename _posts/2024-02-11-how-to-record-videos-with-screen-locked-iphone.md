If you're wondering how to record videos or take photos with the screen off on an iPhone, you've likely discovered a major limitation: **Apple does not allow any app to record video or take pictures with the screen completely off**. This restriction applies to all apps on the App Store due to Apple's strict privacy and security policies.

However, an app called [Discreet - Black Screen Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discreet-black-screen-camera/id1600729989) has developed a solution that comes as close as possible to solving this problem, with a clever workaround: **Black Screen Technology**.

## What Is Black Screen Technology?

Unlike traditional apps that might just dim the display, Discreet's **Black Screen Technology** goes a step further by turning off all the pixels on your screen. This results in a completely black display—not just a dimmed one—which makes it impossible for others to tell that the app is recording video or taking photos. **No one will notice**, but your device will still be actively capturing content.

## How to Use Discreet's Black Screen Mode

Once you’ve installed Discreet on your iPhone or iPad, using the app is incredibly straightforward. The main screen of the app provides simple swipe gestures for navigation:

- **Swipe Left**: This action activates the **Black Screen** mode. Once enabled, all pixels on your screen will turn off, and the app will silently continue recording video or taking photos based on your preferences.
  
- **Swipe Right**: Swiping to the right brings you to the app’s **Private Gallery**. This is where all your media is stored securely, without appearing in your device's public photo gallery. If you want to keep your files private, this feature is perfect for ensuring no one accidentally stumbles across your media.

## Customizing Your Camera Settings

From the app's main screen, you can access the settings menu to further personalize your experience. Discreet provides various customization options to ensure your recordings are exactly how you want them. Here are some key settings:

- **Camera Choice**: Choose between the front or rear camera depending on what you need.
- **Capture Mode**: Decide whether Black Screen mode should capture videos or photos.
- **Image and Video Quality**: You can select up to **4K resolution at 60 frames per second (fps)** for ultra-high-quality recordings.
- **Preview Option**: If you want more control over what you're recording, you can enable a small preview of the camera feed to help you frame your shot. This preview is discreet and blends in with the Black Screen mode.
  
There are many more features and tweaks available in the settings, making Discreet a highly customizable camera app. We encourage you to explore these options to see how they fit your specific needs.

## Conclusion

While it’s impossible to record videos or take photos on an iPhone with the screen completely off due to Apple's restrictions, **Discreet’s Black Screen Technology** is the next best solution. By turning off all the pixels on your screen, the app provides a covert way to capture photos and videos without anyone knowing. Coupled with its secure Private Gallery and customizable settings, Discreet offers a unique and practical tool for anyone looking for a stealth camera app.
