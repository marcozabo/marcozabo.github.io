When it comes to capturing sensitive images or videos, privacy is a top concern. The **Discreet - Black Screen Camera** app offers a unique solution for users who value their privacy. By ensuring that all media files—photos and videos—are saved **locally on the device** and never uploaded to external servers, this app guarantees that only **you** have access to your content. Here’s how Discreet protects your privacy and what you need to be mindful of when using it.

## Local Storage for Maximum Privacy

One of the main ways that Discreet safeguards your privacy is by **storing all files directly on your iPhone or iPad**. Unlike many other apps, Discreet doesn't upload your media to cloud servers or external storage solutions. This means:

- **No third-party access**: Your photos and videos remain on your device, safe from prying eyes.
- **Complete control**: You are the only person who can access or manage your files unless you explicitly share them.
  
This approach ensures that your personal media stays completely private and secure, giving you peace of mind that no one else can access or monitor your captured content.

## The Risks: No Cloud Backup

While the app's commitment to local storage enhances privacy, it also comes with a few important **risks** that users need to be aware of:

### 1. **Deleted Files Are Gone Forever**
Since your media isn't uploaded to a server or cloud, **once a file is deleted, there’s no way to recover it**. Be cautious when deleting any files in the app, as there’s no backup or recovery system in place.

### 2. **Disinstalling the App Will Erase Your Media**
If you ever decide to **uninstall the app**, make sure to first create a backup of your photos and videos. **Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all media stored within it**, and since Discreet doesn't use external servers, there will be no way to recover any lost files.

### 3. **Backup Is Your Responsibility**
To avoid losing important media, you should manually backup your files. You can do this by saving your photos and videos to:
- **Your device's photo gallery**.
- A **cloud storage service** like iCloud, Google Drive, or Dropbox.
- An **external hard drive** or local backup solution.

## How to Stay Safe While Using Discreet

To make the most of the privacy features offered by Discreet while avoiding accidental data loss, here are some key tips:

- **Regularly backup** your photos and videos by exporting them to a safe location.
- **Double-check before deleting** any files within the app to ensure you don’t lose important media.
- **Be cautious when uninstalling** the app. Before doing so, always create a backup of your files to avoid losing them permanently.

## Conclusion

The **Discreet - Black Screen Camera** app offers an excellent solution for users who prioritize privacy, ensuring that all media remains on their device and under their control. However, with great privacy comes great responsibility. Since there’s no cloud backup, you need to take extra precautions to safeguard your files and avoid accidental deletion or loss. By following a few simple steps, you can enjoy the full privacy benefits of Discreet while keeping your important photos and videos safe.
